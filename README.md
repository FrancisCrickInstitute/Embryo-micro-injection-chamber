# Embryo-micro-injection-chamber

Acrylic (PMMA) mould for PDMS casting designed and manufactured in colaboration with Aurélien Courtois from the Turner lab at the Crick.

The mould is composed by 4 parts which are laser cut in 3 mm thickness.

The four parts of the mould are attached using M3 screws.

We have used PDMS in 10:1 ratio with the curing agent. 

Use a pasteur pipette to pour the PDMS inside the mould.

Cure the PDMS at 65°C for 2h.

After removing the PDMS from the mould we plasma bond it using air plasma with a coverslip.
